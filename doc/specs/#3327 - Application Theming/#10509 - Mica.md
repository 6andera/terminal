# Mica in the Terminal

## Abstract

This document serves as a companion doc to the [Theming Spec], rather than a
spec on it's own. The context of broader application-level theming support is
necessary to undertand the big picture of the designs in this discussion.


This spec is intended to help understand the problem space of adding [Mica] to
the Windows Terminal. Introduced in Windows 11, Mica is a new type of material
that incorporates theme and desktop wallpaper to paint the background of
windows. The effect results in a blurred, transparency-like effect, quite
similar to [Acrylic]. However, the technical limitations of Mica make it more
complicated to integrate seemlessly with the Terminal experience.

## Background

Mica is a material that can only be applied to the root of the UI tree, and
applies to the entire background surface. It's recommended to be used at the
`Page` level, in place of a solid brush like
`ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush`. If the developer wants a surface within
the page to have a Mica background, they need to make sure to have that element
(and all elements behind it up until the `Page`) have a `Transparent`
background, so that Mica will be visible through the elements.

This is contrasted with something like Acrylic, where the acrylic effect is
specified at the Element layer itself. An element can request having a
`HostBackdrop` brush for its background, and the element will have the Acrylic
effect regardless of the structure of the rest of the elements in the UI tree.

Another important use case here is "Vintage Transparency" (or "unblurred
transparency"), which is an unblurred transparency effect for the Terminal
window. This is achieved with the `TransparentBackground` API, which enables the
Terminal to disable the emergency backstop of the XAML Island. When that's
enabled, controls that are transparent will be blended, unblurred, with whatever
is visible behind the window. This works because the entire tree of the Terminal
window underneath the `TermControl`s are `Transparent`, all the way up to the
window itself.

Right now, the Terminal exposes three settings<sup>[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup>:
* Background color
* Background Opacity
* Whether the user would like to enable acrylic or not

These settings are exposed at the "Profile"<sup>[[2]](#footnote-2)</sup> level.
Properties on a profile are roughly considered to be "what the terminal control
will look like when I run this settings profile". Users can have one profile
with acrylic, one without, and open [Panes] with these profiles side-by-side in
the Terminal. It's entirely possible that a user would have both a pane with and
acrylic background, and one with an unblurred background in the same window.



### User Stories

* The Terminal should be able to have Mica in the title bar, behind the tabs.
* Users will want Mica in the control area, as well as in the titlebar
* Users may want Mica in the control, but with a solid titlebar, or an accent
  colored title bar, or an acrylic one...
* Users will want mica in the titlebar with other effects (acrylic, vintage
  transparency) in the control area


This is where things get complicated. Given that a control can choose what tyoe
of material it has now, users would likely expect to be able to choose between
acrylic, unblurred transparency, or Mica. However, Mica can only be applied at
the root of the window. It's applied behind everything else in the window. From
an implementation standpoint, Mica is a window-level property, not a control
level one. If we want to have Mica under one control, we need to enable it for
the _whole window_. If we enable Mica for the whole window, that would
simultaneously prevent Vintage Transparency from working as expected. This is
because the semi-transparent controls would no longer have a fully transparent
window background to sit on top of - they'd be blended instead with the Mica
background behind the window.

## Solution design

### Mica for `TermControl`s
If we make enabling Mica for the control a per-profile setting, I believe that
will lead to greater user confusion. It would result in "spooky action at a
distance", where creating any pane with Mica would force the entire window to
have a Mica background. This would change the appearance of any other unburred
transparent panes in the window, causing them to also be subjected to the Mica
treatment as well.

**Proposal**: create a window-level theme property `window.useMica` (or
similar), which will enable Mica for the entire window. When enabled, users can
use a fully transparent, unblurred background for their profile to acheive the
Mica effect within the control. When enabled, users **won't** be able to see
through to the desktop with any vintage opacity settings.

I believe this is the most acceptable way to expose Mica to our users without
"spooky action at a distance".

An example of what mica in the control area might look like:

### Mica in the titlebar

To achieve Mica in the titlebar, we'll similarly need to allow users to set the
titlebar area to totally transparent, to allow the mica behind the window to be
visible. A simple theme to achieve that might look like:

```jsonc
{
    "theme": "My Mica Titlebar Theme",
    "themes": [
        {
            "name": "My Mica Titlebar Theme",
            "window.useMica": true, // Use mica behind the window
            "tabRow.background": "#00000000", // Make the TabView Transparent
        }
    ]
}
```

## Considered implementations

* We experimented with a new DWM API in SV2 which should enable us to set the
  background of our window to Mica. This did seem to work for the root window.
  It however, did not seem to work for the "drag window", the child HWND which
  we use to intercept nonclient messages in our titlebar area. Apparently, that
  API does not work at all for `WS_CHILD` windows, by design. This unfortunately
  prevents us from allowing Mica only in the titlebar area, without also
  applying it to the rest of the main window.

## Potential Issues

This is not a particularly ergonomic design. From a UX perspective, the user
needs to enable one setting in the UI to enable Mica, and then go to profile
settings to set the profile to _transparent_ for each of the profiles they want
with Mica. That's not very intuitive by any means.

### Footnotes

<a name="footnote-1"><a>[1]: For simplicity of the spec, I'm ignoring the
background image settings. I'm also ignoring the small quirk where (at the time
of writing), vintage opacity doesn't work on Windows 10. That creates some weird
quirks where acrylic is always enabled if the user wants transparency on Windows
10. A full discussion of this would only serve to complicate what is
fundamentally a Windows 11-centric discussion.

<a name="footnote-2"><a>[2]: We're also gonna leave out a discussion of focused
& unfocused "appearance" setting objects, again for brevity.
